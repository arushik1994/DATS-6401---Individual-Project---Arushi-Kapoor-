                    In conclusion, it can be stated that US will continue to lead in terms of Total GDP, GDP Per Capita and Overall Spending. China's growth rate has been considerably higher in all types of spending. Therefore, we can 
                    conclude that China is the fastest growing nation in terms of total GDP and Overall Spending. We can also conclude that nations with a higher GDP Per Capita also tend to have a higher Education and Healthcare Spending Per Capita.
                    Certain developed nations such as Australia, Germany and Canada tend to be consistent in their education and healthcare expenditure.<br><br>

                    It is crucial to note that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may have caused the healthcare expenditures of all the 10 nations to soar from 2020 onwards. There exists a high probability that several G-20 nations such as USA, China, Russia, Germany, France, 
                    must have spent a large amount of money towards healthcare innovations such as vaccines to free their respective citizens from the infectious disease.

                    The learning process through this project has been both interesting and challenging.<br>
                    The project equipped me with the required skills needed to visualize complex and large datasets through Google Visualziation API, HTML and Javascript.
